LTeX+ CLI is contained in LTeX+ LS. To use LTeX+ CLI, [download and install LTeX+ LS](installation.html) first.

## Startup

It is recommended to use the startup scripts `bin/ltex-cli` (Linux, Mac) and `bin\ltex-cli.bat` (Windows) to start LTeX+ CLI. These scripts are only part of the released versions (they are not contained in the source repository).

The startup scripts can be controlled by the following environment variables:

- `JAVA_HOME`: Path to the directory of the Java distribution to use (contains `bin`, `lib`, and other subdirectories). If set, this overrides the included Java distribution when using a platform-dependent LTeX+ LS archive.
- `JAVA_OPTS`: Java arguments to be fed to `java` (e.g., `-Xmx1024m`)

It is also possible to start LTeX+ CLI directly without the startup scripts (not recommended).

### Command-Line Arguments

Any command-line arguments supplied to the startup scripts are processed by LTeX+ CLI itself. The possible arguments are as follows:

- `--client-configuration=<file>`: Use the client configuration stored in the JSON file `<file>`. The format is nested JSON objects (e.g., `{"latex": {"commands": ...}}`). A flattened JSON object (`{"latex.commands": ...}`) is also allowed, and setting names may be prefixed by a top level named `ltex` (e.g., `{"ltex.latex.commands": ...}` is accepted as well).
- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.
- `-V`, `--version`: Print version information as JSON to the standard output and exit. The format is a JSON object with `"java"` and `"ltex-ls-plus"` keys and string values. A key may be missing if no information about the corresponding version could be retrieved.
- `<path> <path> ...`: Required. Paths of files or directories to check. Directories are traversed recursively for supported file types. If `-` is given, standard input will be checked as plain text.

Instead of using the equals sign `=` to separate option names and values, it is also possible to use one or more spaces.

### Exit Codes

- 0: LTeX+ CLI exited successfully and no grammar/spelling errors were found.
- 1: An exception was thrown during the execution of LTeX+ CLI.
- 2: An invalid command-line argument was supplied to LTeX+ CLI.
- 3: At least one grammar/spelling error was found.
