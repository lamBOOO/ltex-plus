## How to Install and Use

1. Install the requirements listed above
2. Install coc-ltex by running `:CocInstall coc-ltex-plus`
3. If you want to check LaTeX documents: Add `let g:coc_filetype_map = {'tex': 'latex'}` to `~/.vimrc` (Vim) or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` (workaround for [#425](https://github.com/valentjn/vscode-ltex/issues/425), until [neoclide/coc.nvim#3433](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/pull/3433) is released)
4. Open a LaTeX or a Markdown document
5. Wait until [ltex-ls-plus](../faq.html#whats-the-difference-between-vscode-ltex-plus-ltex-ls-plus-and-languagetool) has been downloaded and started
6. Grammar/spelling errors will be displayed! (if there are any)
