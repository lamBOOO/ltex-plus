The installation of LTeX+ depends on the scenario in which you want to use LTeX+. LTeX+ can be used
- [as an extension for your editor](#via-editor-extensions),
- [as a language client using the Language Server Protocol (LSP)](#via-language-clients), or
- [standalone on the command line](#via-command-line).

Choose the topmost scenario that applies to you.

## Via Editor Extensions

LTeX+ publishes official extensions for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Vim/Neovim via coc.nvim. For some other popular editors, third-party extensions exist that add support for LTeX+. If no extension exists yet for your editor, but your editor supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP), then you should be able to [use LTeX+ as a language client](#via-language-clients).

## Via Language Clients

If your editor is not yet supported by an extension, but it supports the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), then you can use the language server [LTeX+ LS (read here for instructions)](ltex-ls-plus/installation.html).

Typically, the editor starts LTeX+ LS during startup (either locally or remotely), it sends LTeX+ LS your L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X or Markdown document, and LTeX+ LS will respond with a list of the grammar and spelling errors in it. The communication between server and editor is done using the LSP, with a language client as a communication endpoint that runs in the editor.

If your editor already supports the LSP (either natively or via an extension), then writing a language client for LTeX+ should be possible with almost no overhead. If your editor doesn't support the LSP, then you can write a language client yourself that communicates with LTeX+ LS according to the [LSP specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

## Via Command Line

LTeX+ can be run on the command line. In this mode, you supply LT<sub>E</sub>X paths to files and directories to be checked as command-line arguments. The results will be printed to the standard output, and no language client or knowledge of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is necessary.

The command-line interface (CLI) of LTeX+ is included in LTeX+ LS. [Read here for instructions.](ltex-ls-plus/cli-usage.html)
